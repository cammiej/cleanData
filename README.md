Coursera Course Getting &amp; Cleaning Data Class Project

The steps seem right.  I read the discussions which provided clarification and guidance.  In the end, I have a tidy dataset based on the class teachings.  Columns and rows are labeled, observations are in columns and variables in rows, and they are not duplicated.  Unfortunately, work is busy and I cannot give as much time as I need to the project.
